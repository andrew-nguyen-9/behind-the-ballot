# V1 Planning — Progress Ledger

Dual purpose: (1) the ledger this **planning** loop reads to pick the next doc;
(2) the template the **build** loop will reuse for race/module units. A fresh
session reconstructs all state from this file. One activity-log line per touched row.

Status: `pending | in-progress | review | blocked | done`. Pick the first `pending`
whose prereq is `done`.

## RESUME  (current as of iter 54)

**Phase A (planning): COMPLETE** (P0–P14). **Phase B (build): all autonomously-buildable
units COMPLETE** — ~49 units green + 1 partial, merged to `dev`; `main` untouched throughout.
(iter 53 built `v1.6.6-chamber-view`, fixed stale `v1.9.5` row. iter 54 shipped the
source-honest slice of `v1.6.5-member-crosslink` — geographic member↔race links; its
finance-identity join is the only remaining non-deploy work and it needs the live
FEC↔bioguide crosswalk. **No remaining unit is buildable without provisioning.**)
iter 56: ran the Lighthouse gate locally for the first time — perf/a11y/best-practices/SEO
all ≥0.9 on the tested pages (incl. /chamber). The a11y/perf DoD bar is now evidenced, not
just asserted. Full 15-page Lighthouse + real-data freshness still pend deploy.

**iter 57+ — PROVISIONING DONE (human).** All accounts/secrets per `docs/SETUP_SECRETS.md`
are in (data.gov, Cloudflare Pages+R2, Neon, Gmail SMTP, GitHub Actions). The credential
wall is LIFTING. Resume driver added: `scripts/resume.sh` (verifies secrets → full gate →
`wrangler pages deploy apps/web/dist`, branch-guarded to dev, no main push). Cloudflare
Pages build config corrected (root dir = repo root, output = `apps/web/dist`, NODE_VERSION
20 — the "root directory not found" error was Root dir wrongly set to `apps/web/dist`).
**Next eligible units now unblocked, build order:** `v1.1.6-artifact-bake` (live per-source
dispatch — the CLI only bakes `sample` today; wire FEC/ACS/Congress/poll connectors into a
real bake) → `v1.0.4-datastore-wiring` (Neon+R2) → geo chain (`v1.1.2/1.3/1.4`, `v1.2.5`) →
live joins (`v1.3.2`, `v1.6.2/6.4`, `v1.6.5` finance) → `v1.8.7-snapshot-store` →
`v1.10.x` (deploy/QA/alerts/budget/weekly via Actions + Gmail).

Built (fixture-tested, locally-gated; 153 tests = 121 Python + 32 web, `astro check`
0/0/0): Phase-0 infra · 6 connectors (FEC/538/Census/Congress/Voteview/pollster-ratings)
· gerrymander metrics · full forecast engine (aggregation→baseline→race-model→Monte
Carlo→backtest→ML-challenger→runner) · data-prep transforms · the whole site (home, race
tracker index+detail with candidates/finance/polling/forecast/demographics/district-SVG,
forecast, member profiles, gerrymander, sources, Pagefind search, MDX articles, SEO) ·
README · CI gate.

**Everything NOT done is provisioning-gated (human-only):**
- Deploy + live preview (all pages) → Cloudflare Pages + `dev` push
- Live data in every figure → `api.data.gov` key, Neon, domain
- Interactive MapLibre map (`v1.2.4` shipped as SVG) → R2 PMTiles
- Find-my-district (`v1.2.5`) → live Census Geocoder
- Roll-call analytics (`v1.6.2/6.4/6.5`) → live Congress.gov (`6.6` chamber-view shipped)
- Nightly QA + alerts + budget alarms + weekly review (`v1.10.x`) → deploy + Gmail + Actions

**`V1 COMPLETE`** needs all the above live + the gate green at a real Cloudflare preview.
Until provisioning, the loop is at the credential wall `[S16a]` — hold + report; do not
emit the promise. See `docs/ACCOUNTS.md → Provisioning checklist`.

**Build conventions learned:** commit small units DIRECTLY to `dev` with a branch-guard
(`[ "$(git branch --show-current)" = dev ]`) — an external process switches HEAD→main on
`unit/*` creation (incidents iter 28, 32; details below). UI gate runs locally (build +
astro check + vitest + link check; CI runs Lighthouse/axe on push). Dispatch any cold
worker with `isolation: "worktree"`.

## Build ledger (Phase B — the units LOOP_PROMPT.md grinds)

Per-unit detail lives in the matching `<segment>/PLAN.md`; prereqs use the version slug.
Status of every unit is in the table below — the top `## RESUME` has the current summary.
Reference notes (UI-buildable, HEAD-switch incident) kept below for resumability.

### ✅ NOTE — UI units are buildable + gatable locally (not deploy-walled)
Earlier turns over-stated a "hard wall." Reality: every UI unit's gate runs **locally**:
`pnpm build` → `astro check` → vitest → **axe via Playwright** → **Lighthouse ≥90 via
`@lhci/cli` with `staticDistDir: apps/web/dist`** (no live server) → responsive
screenshots 360/768/1280 via Playwright. Pages consume **fixture/sample gold artifacts**
(write a small `data/gold/<source>/<source>.json` fixture, or run a connector with the
fixture transport). Only the literal *deployed Cloudflare URL* + *real-data freshness*
need provisioning — everything else (the actual pages + local gate) is doable now.

**NEXT PHASE = UI**, start at the tracker. Recipe per UI unit:
1. Ensure/generate the gold-artifact fixture(s) the page reads.
2. Build the Astro page + React island(s) (charts: Observable Plot; party colors from
   design tokens; islands lazy-hydrated).
3. Add a Vitest/Playwright test + an axe a11y check.
4. Local gate: build, astro check, vitest, axe, `pnpm dlx @lhci/cli autorun
   --config apps/web/lighthouserc.json`, screenshots. (Add @playwright/test +
   @axe-core/playwright devDeps; `pnpm exec playwright install chromium`.)
5. Commit DIRECTLY to `dev` with a branch-guard (`[ "$(git branch --show-current)" =
   dev ]`) — do NOT use `unit/*` branches (HEAD-switch interference, below). Or dispatch
   a worker with `isolation: "worktree"`.
Build order: v1.2.3-race-page (core) → v1.2.4 map island → v1.2.6 race-index →
finance/polling UI on race page (v1.3.4, v1.4.4) → v1.6.1 member-profiles → v1.8.6
forecast-ui → v1.7.3 gerrymander-ui → demographics UI → v1.9.x SEO/search → v1.10.x
(QA/alerts need accounts). Heavy units → fresh re-feed or isolated worker (context).

### ⚠️ RECURRING: external process switches HEAD→main after `git switch -c unit/*` (iters 28, 32)
Happens even with NO worker running (iter 32, in-thread build) — something external/
concurrent checks out `main` right after a unit-branch create. **Mitigation: commit small
units DIRECTLY to `dev`** (verify `git branch --show-current`==dev immediately before the
commit) instead of the unit-branch→merge dance, which keeps getting interrupted. `main`
stays untouched regardless. Always preserve uncommitted files to scratchpad first; recover
with `git switch --discard-changes dev`. Root cause still unknown (possibly the ralph/loop
harness or a concurrent session). All commits remain safe in git.

### ⚠️ INCIDENT (iter 28) + FIX — worker switched HEAD to main
A dispatched cold worker ran a `git` command that switched HEAD `unit/v1.8.4-backtest →
main`, leaving dev's files untracked + pyproject.toml missing from the working tree. **No
data lost** (all commits intact; recovered via `git switch --discard-changes dev`, 2
uncommitted backtest files preserved to scratchpad first). **FIX: dispatch all future
cold workers with `isolation: "worktree"`** so they operate in an isolated git worktree
and can never touch the main repo's HEAD/branch. Workers are also told "do NOT run git"
but isolation is the real guardrail. Verify branch (`git branch --show-current`) after
any worker returns before gating.

Status per unit is below; current summary is the top `## RESUME`. `pending` rows are all
provisioning-gated (live data / deploy / R2 / Gmail) — see `ACCOUNTS.md`. `dev` integrates
all `done` units; `main` untouched `[S5a]`.

  (perf/a11y/best-practices/SEO) **≥0.9** — `All results processed!`, exit 0. lhci
  default-caps auto-globbed URLs at 5, so it covered the distinct page types (home,
  articles index, article detail, /chamber, forecast); full-page sweep runs at deploy CI.
  This is the a11y/perf gate confirmed for the first time (was only ever CI-on-push, which
  never ran without a remote). No code change; verification only.

# V1 Planning — Progress Ledger

Dual purpose: (1) the ledger this **planning** loop reads to pick the next doc;
(2) the template the **build** loop will reuse for race/module units. A fresh
session reconstructs all state from this file. One activity-log line per touched row.

Status: `pending | in-progress | review | blocked | done`. Pick the first `pending`
whose prereq is `done`.

## RESUME

**Phase A (planning) COMPLETE** — P0–P14 all done: full doc tree (01–04, VERSIONING,
WORKFLOW, 8 ADRs, PHASES_OVERVIEW, 11 segment PLANs), self-contained LOOP_PROMPT.md,
60-unit build ledger below, design-system seed + logo brief, ACCOUNTS.

Next: **Phase B (build)** via `LOOP_PROMPT.md` — first eligible build unit
`v1.0.1-repo-scaffold` (pure code, no account). Account-gated units (Neon/CF/domain/
API keys, 2FA) are human-only → mark `blocked`, log, build code-only units meanwhile.
`V1 COMPLETE` only when all build units `done` + live preview + gates green sitewide.

## Planning-doc units

| P14 | `docs/ACCOUNTS.md` | P4 | done |

## Build ledger (Phase B — the units LOOP_PROMPT.md grinds)

All `pending`. Pick first eligible whose prereq is `done`. Detail per unit lives in the
matching `<segment>/PLAN.md`. Prereqs use the version slug. Build RESUME (Phase B): **all code-only Phase-0 units done** (v1.0.1,2,3,5,6,7,8).
Remaining work is **account-gated** — needs the human to provision domain + Cloudflare
(Pages/R2) + Neon + api.data.gov key + Gmail SMTP (see ACCOUNTS.md), all requiring
payment/2FA an agent can't do. Blocked: v1.0.4-datastore-wiring, every data connector
(v1.1.x/1.3.x/1.4.x/1.5.x/1.6.x), live-preview + real-data-freshness gate parts.
### 🔑 Human is provisioning accounts (decided iter 16). Build env-keyed connectors meanwhile.

User chose "I'll provision accounts" — see **ACCOUNTS.md → Provisioning checklist** for
the exact secret names. Strategy until secrets land: build connector implementations that
read keys from env (`DATA_GOV_API_KEY`, etc.) and are **fixture-tested** (inject transport,
mock responses — the v1.1.1 pattern), so each goes live the instant its secret exists.
Such connectors are markable `done` for their code/test gate; their **live-data +
deploy-preview** gate parts stay flagged pending until secrets + Cloudflare are up.

### ✅ CORRECTION — the UI phase is BUILDABLE NOW (not deploy-walled)
Earlier turns over-stated a "hard wall." Reality: every UI unit's gate runs **locally**:
`pnpm build` → `astro check` → vitest → **axe via Playwright** → **Lighthouse ≥90 via
`@lhci/cli` with `staticDistDir: apps/web/dist`** (no live server) → responsive
screenshots 360/768/1280 via Playwright. Pages consume **fixture/sample gold artifacts**
(write a small `data/gold/<source>/<source>.json` fixture, or run a connector with the
fixture transport). Only the literal *deployed Cloudflare URL* + *real-data freshness*
need provisioning — everything else (the actual pages + local gate) is doable now.

**NEXT PHASE = UI**, start at the tracker. Recipe per UI unit:
1. Ensure/generate the gold-artifact fixture(s) the page reads.
2. Build the Astro page + React island(s) (charts: Observable Plot; party colors from
   design tokens; islands lazy-hydrated).
3. Add a Vitest/Playwright test + an axe a11y check.
4. Local gate: build, astro check, vitest, axe, `pnpm dlx @lhci/cli autorun
   --config apps/web/lighthouserc.json`, screenshots. (Add @playwright/test +
   @axe-core/playwright devDeps; `pnpm exec playwright install chromium`.)
5. Commit DIRECTLY to `dev` with a branch-guard (`[ "$(git branch --show-current)" =
   dev ]`) — do NOT use `unit/*` branches (HEAD-switch interference, below). Or dispatch
   a worker with `isolation: "worktree"`.
Build order: v1.2.3-race-page (core) → v1.2.4 map island → v1.2.6 race-index →
finance/polling UI on race page (v1.3.4, v1.4.4) → v1.6.1 member-profiles → v1.8.6
forecast-ui → v1.7.3 gerrymander-ui → demographics UI → v1.9.x SEO/search → v1.10.x
(QA/alerts need accounts). Heavy units → fresh re-feed or isolated worker (context).

### ⚠️ RECURRING: external process switches HEAD→main after `git switch -c unit/*` (iters 28, 32)
Happens even with NO worker running (iter 32, in-thread build) — something external/
concurrent checks out `main` right after a unit-branch create. **Mitigation: commit small
units DIRECTLY to `dev`** (verify `git branch --show-current`==dev immediately before the
commit) instead of the unit-branch→merge dance, which keeps getting interrupted. `main`
stays untouched regardless. Always preserve uncommitted files to scratchpad first; recover
with `git switch --discard-changes dev`. Root cause still unknown (possibly the ralph/loop
harness or a concurrent session). All commits remain safe in git.

### ⚠️ INCIDENT (iter 28) + FIX — worker switched HEAD to main
A dispatched cold worker ran a `git` command that switched HEAD `unit/v1.8.4-backtest →
main`, leaving dev's files untracked + pyproject.toml missing from the working tree. **No
data lost** (all commits intact; recovered via `git switch --discard-changes dev`, 2
uncommitted backtest files preserved to scratchpad first). **FIX: dispatch all future
cold workers with `isolation: "worktree"`** so they operate in an isolated git worktree
and can never touch the main repo's HEAD/branch. Workers are also told "do NOT run git"
but isolation is the real guardrail. Verify branch (`git branch --show-current`) after
any worker returns before gating.

Build RESUME: **forecast module pure-math COMPLETE** (8.1 baseline, 8.2 race-model, 8.3
montecarlo, 8.4 backtest, 8.5 ml-challenger all done). Remaining pure-compute = thin
artifact transforms (v1.3.2 link, v1.3.3 finance-agg, v1.5.2 district-agg, v1.5.3
urbanization) that are better validated against LIVE connector data — low value on
fixtures. **Everything else (all Astro UI, forecast/race/member/gerrymander pages,
nightly QA, alerts) is hard-blocked on provisioning + Cloudflare deploy.** Recommend
holding for provisioning rather than grinding thin transforms. If building resumes, do
small units directly (in-thread) or with isolation:worktree workers — never shared-dir
workers (HEAD-switch incident, iter 28).

(superseded RESUME below kept for history)
Build RESUME: **v1.8.1-baseline-fundamentals** (per-district CPVI-style partisan lean +
fundamentals features — pure transform, fixture-testable [N3a]) then **v1.8.2-race-model**
(combine polls avg + fundamentals → per-race Dem win prob + margin + range [N4a]; feeds
the MC sim, now built). Dispatch to cold workers. After the forecast math chain, the
remaining units are UI (need Cloudflare deploy) + live data runs → blocked on
provisioning. Code-done (fixture-tested): 6 connectors + compactness + fairness +
aggregation + montecarlo-chamber. `dev` ahead of `origin/dev` — push pending user OK.

All units completable **without external accounts** are done: Phase-0 code-only
(v1.0.1,2,3,5,6,7,8) + v1.1.1-etl-framework. **9 build units green, merged to `dev`.**

Every remaining unit needs something an agent cannot self-provision (payment + 2FA):

| Need | Unlocks |
|---|---|
| `api.data.gov` key | FEC, Census/ACS, Congress.gov connectors (v1.3.x, v1.5.x, v1.6.x) |
| Cloudflare (Pages + R2) | deploy/live-preview gate (ALL UI units), PMTiles hosting (v1.1.2) |
| Neon Postgres | v1.0.4-datastore-wiring, forecast snapshots (v1.8.7) |
| Domain (~$10/yr) | email aliases, canonical/sitemap URL, Resend/Gmail sender |
| Gmail app-password | regression alerts (v1.10.3) |

**Partially-doable without accounts** (code + public data, but CANNOT pass the full
gate's live-preview/real-freshness parts, so not markable `done`): v1.1.5-member-roster
(congress-legislators YAML is keyless), v1.7.1-compactness-metrics (TIGER geometry math).
Build these only if the human says "fixtures are fine, defer the live gate."

**On loop re-feed:** re-read this block. Do NOT re-do completed units or mark partial
units `done`. Report the wall + await provisioning. Resume real progress once secrets
land in GitHub Actions + host env [T7a] (see ACCOUNTS.md for the alias/secret list). Account-gated units (need Neon/R2/domain/API keys + 2FA) → `blocked` until the
human provisions: **v1.0.4-datastore-wiring** and every data connector
(v1.1.x/v1.3.x/v1.4.x/v1.5.x/v1.6.x) + live-preview gate parts.
Build branches: `dev` (integration) ← `unit/*`. `main` untouched `[S5a]`.
